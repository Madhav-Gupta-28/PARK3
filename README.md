# Inter Planetary Cultural Storage (IPCS) Network

## ETH HACK FS 2023 <br>

We are preserving cultural histories and places with a Data DAO.
<br>
Using a Data DAO we create custom storge solutions for cultural history on decentralised FS.
<br>
This enables science communities to study public data and use it for analysis and significant innovations for public goods. 
<br>

## First we establish a standard for Cultural Data Preservation. 

<br>

Define the attributes of the files to be stored.
<br>
<br>
GOAL: Create a publically verifiable state of the culture at a given time.

The "IPCS" DataDao is growing a community of people that protect and preserve cultures and public places.
