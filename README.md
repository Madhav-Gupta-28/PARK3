# Inter Planetary Cultural Storage (IPCS) 

## ETH HACK FS 2023 <br>

We made a Data DAO for Cultural History.  Stories of cultures, arts and people are preserved by a decentralized network using the IPCS “inter planetary cultural storage” contracts.

<li>Testnet contracts for end-users to administer the File Storage in the collection<br></li>
<li>Empowering historians with provenance and future royalties or collaborations<br></li>
<li>Ability to store large data collections like National Archives <br></li>
<br>
Used by: <br>

Historians, UNESCO, Content Creators, and Art Collections, AI and ML

Ideal for:<br>
National Libraries, Collections, Public Archives, Large Photo Libraries

Example Decentralized Science: The IPCS app can be used for cross-border decentralized science allowing historians to adopt Data DAO rules for computing with data from global heritage sites and large archives. 

  

### OUR USE CASE:

IPCS is a "Global Cultures Data Dao"
Members of the Data DAO record cultural histories of communities, local arts, photos and stories of cultural diversity in significant places that must be preserved.  This solution creates "large shared data-sets" that can be used by governments, schools, museums and other archivists in decentralized science. For our use we have included one of the most culturally diverse places in Los Angeles, a park in East LA.

### How it's Made
<li>Upload to IPFS - Preserving cultural histories and places in a dynamic data verification and processing system.<br></li>
<li>Creating standards for archival data in a new decentralized records network. Using NFT.Storage<br></li>
<li>Creating data governance and storage options and perpetual storage deals for archivists and historians. using FileCoin Storage and Litehouse<br></li>
<li>Using Livepeer for storing the Videos , and using livepeer for original video creator "Attestations", so that the members of the network can be recognized or rewarded when their data is used or remixed<br></li>
<li>Using ENS for integrations with web3 community and profiles<br></li>

<br>

Filecoin<br>
We were inspired by FIL and Protocol Labs to innovate with DataDAO technology. We built this project with FVM to enable curation, use, and governance of valuable cultural Datasets.

Nft.storage<br>
We are answering the NFT.storage teams call for Social Good Warriors: Making sustainability, and preventing misinformation a part of the IPCS system.  

Livepeer<br>
We were inspired by Livepeer team to use creator signing, and video provenance, that will insure the future value of the content is reflected to the creators, and collaborators.


Lighthouse<br>
This was very helpful for developing our storage app for end users. 


ENS<br>
We were inspired to make our App simple and easy for our users through ENS. Integration with ENS name and avatar resolution create a more efficient solution for cultural storage in our use case of a Data DAO.


Apecoin<br>
Apecoin is the ideal community inspiration and is a part of our creator content tooling that allows IPCS to store the cultural histories of our communities.
