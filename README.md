### CULTURAL PRESERVATION USE CASE:

<br>
<b>The people of Quintana Roo wish to preserve their cultural heritage and insure a Mural and Statue are preserved.</b> 
<br>

<br>
- Preserve Immutable Video History and Statements Of Fact on Park3<br>
<br>

<b>PROBLEMS FOR PUBLIC PARKS ADMINISTRATORS</b> <br><br>
    •    Public Parks and spaces have untapped potential and <u>need trusted data</u>. <br>
    •    In Los Angeles a park is being built with Original Art and Data in QR codes. <br>
    •    City Lawyers want a solution that can not be corrupted or hacked, and if ever compromised can be restored automatically. 
<br>

## Why are public spaces ideal for off-chain verification and Hyperstructures?

- Public Parks are Accessible to humans without red tape, ticketing, oversight etc.<br>
- Open near 365 days per year in most cases<br>
- A shared responsibility of a geographic community<br>
- Large Value in Real Estate Holdings <br>
- Legal Obligations for administrators<br><br>
