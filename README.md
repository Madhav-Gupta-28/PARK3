## Using File Storage For Aligned Network Particpants.

First we establish a standard for Cultural Data Preservation. 
<br>
<br>

Define the attributes of the files to be stored.
<br>
<br>
<b>GOAL: Create a publically verifiable state .</b>
<br>

The "IPCS" DataDao is growing a community of people that protect and preserve cultures and public places.

<b>PROBLEMS FOR PUBLIC PARKS ADMINISTRATORS</b> <br><br>
    •    Public Parks and spaces have untapped potential and <u>need trusted data</u>. <br>
    •    In Los Angeles a park is being built with Original Art and Data in QR codes. <br>
    •    City Lawyers want a solution that can not be corrupted or hacked, and if ever compromised can be restored automatically. 
<br>

- Art in public places is Accessible<br>
- Open near 365 days per year in most cases<br>
- A shared responsibility of a geographic community<br>
